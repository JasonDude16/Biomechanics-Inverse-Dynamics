# Biomechanics-Lab-3
The scripts in this repository calculate inverse dynamics from analog force plate data and marker position data. 

The jdmodel.m is the main script file. This file loads the data, creates a data summary and creates the plots that are depicted below.

This analysis can be created, but the file path will need to be changed from absolute to relative by the user.
